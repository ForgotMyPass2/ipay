To add database, first create an empty database "ipay".
Then, move database.sql to home/user root folder and run

 mysqldump -u <user> -p ipay < database.sql

also, change mysql username in program to your preference (change to root if you are not sure what your mysql username is)

if in doubt, just contact me :)
